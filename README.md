### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an iOS developer at Jaguar Land Rover! I started my iOS journey in Jan 2021 and have loved it since - as is true for most iOS devs out there ðŸ˜‰

I also write articles on Medium to simplify Swift concepts - [**Swift Simplified**](https://swiftsimplified.medium.com)

You can find me on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/harshv_arora) and [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshvardhanarora/)!
